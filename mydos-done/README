 myDOS -  myDOS
 ==============================

 This programming exercise consists of extending the example tyDOS, provided
 under the directory 'eg/tydos'. The source code illustrates a DOS-like
 program that runs in x86 real-mode. TyDOS already implements a trivial
 command-line interpreter that can execute built-in functions: if the user
 enters one of the existing command names, tyDOS runs a corresponding routine;
 if the command does not correspond to any command, tyDOS tell them so and
 does nothing.

 The present challenge is to improve the interpreter such that, if the word
 entered by the user does not correspond to any existing command name, then
 the OS searches for a file with that name in the storage media where the
 kernel was booted from, loads the program file into the RAM, and let it
 execute to completion. After the program terminates, the execution flow
 should return to the OS, and the prompt of the command-line should be
 available to the user once more.

 The example also implements a syscall handler, which the user program can
 invoke to request OS services. Rather than issuing the syscall directly,
 though, the programmer should take advantage of a small custom user library
 that should then be linked against the executable. The current challenge
 also includes the task of creating a syscall 'read' that reads from the
 keyboard, creating a function 'gets' that evokes it, and then using the
 function in a an example user program.
 
 For the purpose of illustration, the project already comes with a user program
 example that is statically linked to the kernel, such that it is automatically
 loaded by the bootloader (in a formatted media, the bootloader, the kernel
 and the fake user program, all linked into one single binary, would fit the
 reserved sector area). We want to extend the example to load the program,
 given its name, from a formatted storage media --- what implies implementing
 support for the media's file system.

 In order to simplify the necessary work, the exercise proposes to select the
 trivial file system TyFS, explored in the examples 'eg/tyfs', that should be
 easy to understand and to implement.

 To complete the exercise, you are expected to:

 * implement the support to tyFS in tyDOS;
 * implement the syscall 'read', and a function 'gets' that evokes it;
 * implement a built-in command that lists the contents of the disk;
 * extend the command intepreter to load and execute external programs;

 * create a user program 'userp' that calls that function.
 * Format a disk image with tyFS;
 * Write the image of your modified DOS into the disk's reserved sectors
 * Copy 'userp' into the tyFS formatted disk (using tyfsedit)
 * Boot the disk image
 * From the command interpreter prompt, execute 'userp'.


 Directions
 ------------------------------

 This directory contains a copy of TyDOS source code.

 Proceed as indicated by the instructor to to export the code example into
 your own project. After that, follow the steps below.

 1) Play with tyDOS and tyFS.

    Visit both examples, read the documentation, build and execute some
    experiments to get acquainted with them. 

 2) Build and execute myDOS in this directory.

   make
   make mydos.bin/run

   Try the command 'help' and follow the instructions.

 3) Please, chose an original name for your project.

    Yeah... that. You know, it's a programmer's duty to honor their projects
    with a distinctive name. Do not fail with the venerable traditions.

    At least edit the greeting messages (e.g. the prompt) and, preferably, the
    logo accordingly. You can also edit the variable 'dos' in 'build.mk'
    and rename source files to match the changes.

 4) Create a tyfs disk image.

    Add a rule in your 'Makefile' to create a zeroed 1.44M floppy image
    'disk.img' (see 'img' rule in 'eg/tyfs/build.mk).

    You can use the script 'eg/tyfs/format' to help with that.

 6) Make the disk image boot your DOS program.

    Add a rule to your 'Makefile' to write 'mydos.bin' into 'disk.img'.
    Remember that you should not overwrite the tyFS header in the disk,
    or else you'll corrupt the file system (see the option 'skip'
    of the utility 'dd'). Also, mind that you must have formatted your
    media with sufficient boot sectors to accommodate your DOS.

 7) Boot your DOS from the disk image.

    Try it with QEMU x86 emulator.

       make mydos.bin/run

    should do it (replace 'mydos' with your DOS name).

 8) Implement a built-in command that lists the contents of the disk.

    Study the source code of 'tyfsedit' and figure out how to implement
    the functionality into your kernel.

    Remember that the FS header is already in RAM (it was loaded by BIOS
    during the boot). You can easily access it using plain C.

    In the header you have all the information to locate the directory
    region. You can then load it (using the BIOS disk service.) into RAM
    and go through and the file names, again, in plain C.
    
 9) Create a loadable user program 'userp.c' like prog.c.

    In tyDOS example, 'prog.o' was directly linked into the kernel and
    we could execute it simply by calling it's 'main' function. That was
    possible because, when 'tydos.bin' was built, the linker could resolve
    the symbol 'main'.

    Now, 'main' is in the user program, and the link-editor does not know
    anything about 'prog' at the time 'mydos.bin' is built.  Try to figure
    out how to handle this new scenario before reading on.

    Ok, that's how OSes do it.

    First, notice that the binary 'prog.bin' is missing the old'n good
    runtime initializer. The tip is: create a file crt0.S where you
    define the symbol '_start' as the very first function and, from there,
    call 'main'. Then, modify 'prog.ld' so that 'crt0.S' is prepended
    to 'prob.bin' (you'll need to update 'build.mk' accordingly).
    
    Since '_start' is guaranteedly the start of 'userp.bin' code, and
    since you know where the kernel has loaded the program, you can
    make a "virtual" call to _start by pushing the return address
    onto the stack and jumping to the program load address; the return
    from main will happily find the address and pop it.

    Note: how to get the return address to push it onto the stack is not
    necessarily obviously. On x86 real mode (and even in 32-bit for that
    matter), you can't read the value of the instruction pointer register
    to know where is the address of the next instruction. The trick, here
    is to call an auxiliary function whose only purpose is to "discover"
    the current execution address. For instance

        (asm code...)
	call get_ip_into_ax  
	(push the return address and jmp to main)
	

      get_ip_into_ax:
        mov (%sp), %ax		# Load %ax with the return address
	ret

    The function 'get_ip_into_ax' is called often called a thunk function.

 10) Implement a new syscall and call it from a new library function.

   Finally, to end with all honor and glory, add a new syscall to your kernel
   that reads the user input from the keryboard. The kernel already has this
   capability and you can reuse it to implement the syscall. See 'bios2.S'
   and 'syscall.c' to see how this is done for 'sys_write'.

   Then, increment the user library 'libtydos.a' by implementing the
   user function

   	void gets(char *buffer)

   that reads the user input and stores it into 'buffer'.

   Now, create a new program 'userp.c' that uses both 'puts' and 'gets' to
   read the user name and print the string "Hello <name>".

   Add a rule to your makefile 'build.mk' that builds 'userp.bin' and copy
   it into 'disk.img' (you use use 'eg/tyfs/put' for that). Then boot the
   image with the emulator, and execute the 'userp.bin' from the command-line
   interpreter.

   Lastely, if you're brave:

   get a USB stick, copy the disk image into it, and then try to boot and
   run your DOS in the real x86 hardware.

   If you've made it this far, now stop. Rest your hands, take a deep breath.
   Slide your chair away from the desk, lean back, half-close your eyes, and,
   contemplating your creation, acknowledge to yourself: 'Damn, Iâ€™m good.'

     

 

 Bintools: convenience rules for inspecting binary files
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 
 SYSeg's Bintools is a collection of Makefile rules aimed as shortcut for
 invoking binary inspection utilities. It contains handy Make rules for
 disassembling objects, comparing files, creating bootable images, invoking
 platform emulators and other facilities. Some shortcuts are ad hoc rules
 crafted under poetic license and may depart from conventional Make usage.

 CONVENTIONS
 
 As a rule of thumb, a file named

     foo.bar            contains the working implementation
     foo-beta.bar	contains working but cumbersome/inelegant implementation
     foo-alpha.bar	contains incomplete or wrong implementation

 File extensions:

   -`hex`  ASCII file containing values in hexadecimal representation;

   -`asm`  manually written assembly code in Intel ASM format;

   -`S`    manually written assembly code in AT&T Gas format;

   -`s`    assembly code in AT&T Gas format generated by the compiler (gcc);

   -`o`    object code produced by the assembler;

   -`i`    pre-processed source code generated by the pre-processor (CPP)

   -`bin`  flat-binary file generated by the linker;

   -`iso`  ISO9660 (ECMA-119) file system intended for optical disk media (CD) 

   -`ld`   linker script (ld).


 Some examples allow alternative build recipes which can be selected
 by passing the command-line variable 'ALT=<number>' to 'make'. See bellow.

 NEEDED SOFTWARE

 In order to experiment with the examples in this section, the following
 pieces of software may be needed. The list indicates the lowest versions
 against which the project has been tested. Using a more recent version should
 be ok, but it is not absolutely guaranteed that results won't exhibit minor
 variations. Feedback is always appreciated.

 If required for a particular example, it is safe to use

 - Linux         5.13.0         (any decent ditribution)
 - gcc 	     	 9.3.0	        (the GNU compiler)
 - GNU binutils  2.34		(GNU assembler, linker, disassembler etc.) 
 - nasm		 2.14.02	(NASM assembler)
 - qemu		 4.2.1		(most probably qemu-system-i386)
 - gcc-multilib  9.3.0		(to compile 32-bit code in a 64-bit platform)
 - xorriso	 1.5.2-1	(depending on your computer's BIOS)
 - hexdump	 POSIX.2	(binary editor)
 
 CONVENIENCE RULES 


 * For building and inspecting binaries, use

   make					     Build the default target.

   make foo				     Build foo.

   make diss IMG=foo 			     Disassemble foo.

   	     	     			     Optionally,

					        ASM  = intel | att  (default)
						BIT  =    16 | 32   (default)

   make clean			             Undo make all

   make diff foo bar baz		     Show graphical diff between files

   	     	     			     ASM and BIT variables apply


  * If any example involves the manipulation of a bootable image, use
  

   make run IMG=foo	             	     Run foo in the emulator

   make stick IMG=foo DEVICE=/dev/sdX        make a bootable USB stick


   SHORTCUTS

   For further convenience, the build script offers some ad hoc shortcuts:
   

   make foo/diss | foo/d		     disassemble .text as 32-bit AT&T

   make foo/diss intel|att		     disassemble as 32-bit Intel or AT&T
   make foo/diss 16|32			     disassemble as 16-bit or 32-bit
   make foo/diss intel|att 16|32	     disassemble as Intel|AT&T 16|32 bit
   make foo/diss 16|32 intel|att	     disassemble as Intel|AT&T 16|32 bit

   make foo/i32	         | foo/i	     disassemble as Intel 32-bit

   		   			     In all disassembly rules, a
					     trailing '*' means disassemble all
					     sections, e.g. foo/d* foo/16* ...

   make foo/hex | foo/raw | foo/dump	     show raw contents in hexadecimal

   make foo/run				     test foo (mbr) with the emulator
   make foo/fd				     test foo (floppy) with the emulator
